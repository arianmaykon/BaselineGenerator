Just a simple app to help configuration management tasks, for now, baseline generation, with test and release baselines already been generated. Sorry for the stupid name :)


BaselineGenerator
=============

(Work in progress...)

How to use

Clone the repo to your apache "htdocs" folder running the above commands in the terminal:
cd /var/www/
git clone https://github.com/arianmaykon/BaselineGenerator.git
After the clone operation ends, execute:
cd BaselineGenerator
./symfony project:permissions
cp config/databases.yml-dist config/databases.yml
cp apps/frontend/config/app.yml-dist apps/frontend/config/app.yml
Edit the config/databases.yml file to configure your database connection:
Opcional - You can set the database connection with the command (change the mysql to another DBMS if you desire): ./symfony configure:database "mysql:host=YOURSERVER;dbname=blgenerator" dbuser dbpassword
To create the database schema and tables, run: ./symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load --no-confirmation
